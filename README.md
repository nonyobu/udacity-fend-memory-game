## Introduction
This is a project for [Udacity](www.udacity.com) FEND Nanodegree.
We were given an starter project that had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project.
I've converted this project from a static to an interactive one.
To do so, the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file were modified.
